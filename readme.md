## Challenges and Learning

* At first most of our code was syntaxically error prone. So we learn to code with correct syntax.

* We learn to read code of our fellow team members. We also learn to find the bugs in other's code.

* There are additional features in our website which of that was not covered in our curriculum. So we decided to learn it ourselves and add it in our project.

* Our understanding of the topic taught became clear.

* We learn to collabrorate on Github.
